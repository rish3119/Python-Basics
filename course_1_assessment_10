#seqmut-1-9: Which of these is the accumulator variable?

byzo = 'hello world!'
c = 0
for x in byzo:
    z = x + "!"
    print(z)
    c = c + 1
A. byzo
B. x
C. z
D. c

#ANS. D

✔️ Yes, this is the accumulator variable. By the end of the program, it will have a full count of how many items are in byzo.


#seqmut-1-10: Which of these is the sequence?

cawdra = ['candy', 'daisy', 'pear', 'peach', 'gem', 'crown']
t = 0
for elem in cawdra:
    t = t + len(elem)
A. cawdra
B. elem
C. t

#ANS A
✔️ Yes, this is the sequence that we iterate over.


#seqmut-1-11: Which of these is the iterator (loop) variable?

lst = [5, 10, 3, 8, 94, 2, 4, 9]
num = 0
for item in lst:
    num += item
A. item
B. lst
C. num

#ANS A
✔️ Yes, this is the iterator variable. It changes each time but is not the whole sequence itself.




#seqmut-1-12: What is the iterator (loop) variable in the following?

rest = ["sleep", 'dormir', 'dormire', "slaap", 'sen', 'yuxu', 'yanam']
let = ''
for phrase in rest:
    let += phrase[0]
The iterator variable is

#ANS  phrase

Good work!

#Currently there is a string called str1. Write code to create a list called chars which should contain the characters from str1. Each character in str1 should be its own element in the list chars.


str1 = "I love python"

    chars.append(i)chars = []
for i in str1:

#seqmut-1-2: Which method would you use to figure out the position of an item in a list?

.insert()

#seqmut-1-3: Which method is best to use when adding an item to the end of a list?


.append()




# 1. Write code to add ‘horseback riding’ to the third position (i.e., right before volleyball) in the list sports.

sports = ['cricket', 'football', 'volleyball', 'baseball', 'softball', 'track and field', 'curling', 'ping pong', 'hockey']
sports.insert(2, 'horseback riding')

# 2. Write code to take ‘London’ out of the list trav_dest.

trav_dest = ['Beirut', 'Milan', 'Pittsburgh', 'Buenos Aires', 'Nairobi', 'Kathmandu', 'Osaka', 'London', 'Melbourne']
trav_dest.pop(7)

# 3. Write code to add ‘Guadalajara’ to the end of the list trav_dest using a list method.

trav_dest = ['Beirut', 'Milan', 'Pittsburgh', 'Buenos Aires', 'Nairobi', 'Kathmandu', 'Osaka', 'Melbourne']
trav_dest.append('Guadalajara')

# 4. Write code to rearrange the strings in the list winners so that they are in alphabetical order from A to Z.

winners = ['Kazuo Ishiguro', 'Rainer Weiss', 'Youyou Tu', 'Malala Yousafzai', 'Alice Munro', 'Alvin E. Roth']
winners.sort()

# 5. For each character in the string saved in ael, append that character to a list that should be saved in a variable app.

ael = "python!"
app = []
for w in ael:
    app.append(w)
print(app)

# 6. For each string in wrds, add ‘ed’ to the end of the word (to make the word past tense).
# Save these past tense words to a list called past_wrds.

wrds = ["end", 'work', "play", "start", "walk", "look", "open", "rain", "learn", "clean"]

past_wrds = [word + "ed" for word in wrds]
print(past_wrds)



# 7.  Write code to switch the order of the winners list so that it is now Z to A. Assign this list to the variable z_winners.
winners = ['Alice Munro', 'Alvin E. Roth', 'Kazuo Ishiguro', 'Malala Yousafzai', 'Rainer Weiss', 'Youyou Tu']
z_winners = winners
z_winners.reverse()
print(z_winners)
